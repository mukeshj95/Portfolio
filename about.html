			<p>Born and raised in Mirzapur District, UP I went to school just like many. Throughout education I always excelled in the artistic topics, from building a WebSites for fun and innovotive mind working on startup strategies. This led to me heading down the creative route in college and university, choosing subjects such as IT industry & Design as my main focus. I decided that I wanted to be a Web Designer at quite a young age (with superhero and secret agent being backup careers), and went on to land my desired job and began working as a Graphic and Web Designer in the field.</p>
			
			<p>In October 2016 I started investing in myself working on skills required to be a good web designer from online courses. A personal website over at Github.com, originally to experiment with the JavaScript application and to give myself a digitial playground to practice and develop new techniques. This continued on an upward trend ever since and the site has now gained fame and recognition around the world, resulting in staggering traffic and subscriber stats, both in the tens of thousands.</p>
